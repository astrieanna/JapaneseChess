How to Play
--------------------------------------------------

run the Shogi Dokoro UI and regstrate Julia/Main.jl as Shogi Engine.
please add "#!/your/Julia/executable/path" in the top of Julia/Main.jl.
for example: #!/home/kimrin/julia-master/julia

(Before registrate Shogi Engine, comment out Main.jl's "please commented out when registration"
require command lines, and registrate. After registration, uncommented out these lines.)

A necessary file "fv.bin" in top directory is not belonging our repository 
(Because of different distribution LICENSE).

Please download recent "Bonanza" Shogi program and copy "fv.bin" into this directory.
